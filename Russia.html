				A Russian athlete has been caught doping in the Winter Olympics, this time for <strong>curling</strong>. Krushelnitckii, and his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova, voluntarily gave back the medals they won last week during the doubles curling event in Pyeongchang. Krushelnitckii was planning to file a case for intial postive doping test, but he ended dropping it after he failed the second doping test. It is stated that Krushelnitckii was positive for meldonium, a drug that improves your circulation in your body giving you more stamina. Krushelnitckii and his wife Anastasia are surely not to be the last doping incident in the 2018 Winter Olympics.
