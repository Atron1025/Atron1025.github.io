		On iOS, it is possible to track screen time and set limits without downloading any apps. You can go into the Settings <br>
		then into Screen Time.

		<br>
		 From there, you can set time limits for individual apps, or set a period of time where you can only <br>
		make phone calls and use a few apps. You can also have your parents set a passcode to manage these settings, so you won't <br>
		be tempted to disable them.
